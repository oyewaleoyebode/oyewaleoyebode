# About Me

I’m Oyebode Oluwatobi Oyewale, a Master’s student at the Cyber Resilience Laboratory, NAIST (Japan). I specialize in voice biometrics and the development of secure speaker verification systems. My research bridges artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and practical deployment, particularly for mobile banking in underserved and low-resource environments.

## Research Projects

### 1. Optimizing Voice Biometric Verification in Banking 

**Biometric verification** is essential for **secure identity verification** and **authentication** during banking transactions, using **fingerprints**, **facial features**, **irises**, and **voices**. **Voice biometrics** is a **promising** alternative among these methods, owing to its **potential for robust and convenient user authentication**.

However, their effectiveness is significantly challenged by **variations in the voice** caused by **different device configurations** and **environmental conditions**. These variations can **reduce the effectiveness** of speaker identification and **undermine the reliability** of voice-based systems in **securing online transactions**. This study addresses these challenges to an **effective comparative solution** by focusing on the difficulties posed by **voice variations** resulting from differences in **device hardware**, **microphone quality**, and **environmental noise**.

Our approach employs **machine learning techniques** using **advanced speech enhancement methods** to **improve the consistency and accuracy of voice biometric verification across diverse devices**. Specifically, we employ an **adaptive filter** model that enhances **signal extraction**, **noise suppression**, and **predictive precision**. Furthermore, our **empirical demonstration** demonstrated that **the adaptive filter significantly improved the accuracy of voice biometric systems by mitigating the impact of device-induced voice variations**. In addition, we evaluate the performance of this model using a range of **metrics**.

**This project addresses the challenges of device variation and environmental noise in voice-based banking systems. I adopted a machine learning approach, combining CNN-LSTM architectures with speech enhancement techniques (including adaptive filtering) to improve speaker consistency across devices.**

### 2. Real-Time Speaker Identification System  
Developed a speaker identification pipeline that uses fused embeddings from Whisper and ECAPA-TDNN. The system performs one-to-many speaker verification without requiring passphrases. It is designed for low-end mobile devices in real-time banking use cases.
> Repositories Coming Soon

### 3. Degradation-Aware Verification Framework  
Proposed and implemented Predictive Degradation Threshold Modeling (PDTM), which forecasts verification risks based on SNR, MFCC variability, and previous outcomes. This enables adaptive security controls like liveness detection and fallback mechanisms.

> Repositories Coming Soon
