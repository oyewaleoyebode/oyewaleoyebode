# About Me

I’m Oyebode Oluwatobi Oyewale, a Master’s student at the Cyber Resilience Laboratory, NAIST (Japan). I specialize in voice biometrics and the development of secure speaker verification systems. My research bridges artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and practical deployment, particularly for mobile banking in underserved and low-resource environments.

## Research Projects

### 1. Optimizing Voice Biometric Verification in Banking  
This project addresses the challenges of device variation and environmental noise in voice-based banking systems. I adopted a machine learning approach, combining CNN-LSTM architectures with speech enhancement techniques (including adaptive filtering) to improve speaker consistency across devices.
> Repositories Coming Soon

### 2. Real-Time Speaker Identification System  
Developed a speaker identification pipeline that uses fused embeddings from Whisper and ECAPA-TDNN. The system performs one-to-many speaker verification without requiring passphrases. It is designed for low-end mobile devices in real-time banking use cases.
> Repositories Coming Soon

### 3. Degradation-Aware Verification Framework  
Proposed and implemented Predictive Degradation Threshold Modeling (PDTM), which forecasts verification risks based on SNR, MFCC variability, and previous outcomes. This enables adaptive security controls like liveness detection and fallback mechanisms.

> Repositories Coming Soon
